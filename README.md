****Cake Filling Optimization Project****

*Project Overview*

This project focuses on optimizing the production quantities and pricing strategies for special and basic cake fillings to maximize revenue. Given the constraints on ingredient availability and the demand for each type of filling, the project employs two metaheuristic algorithms: Local Search and Threshold Accepting (TA). These algorithms help navigate through the complex decision space to find the optimal solutions.

*Algorithms Used*

Local Search: Iteratively adjusts filling quantities and prices to find revenue-maximizing solutions within the given constraints.
Threshold Accepting (TA): Similar to Local Search but includes a mechanism to occasionally accept worse solutions to avoid local optima, enhancing the potential to find better overall solutions.
Repository Structure
optimization_code.R: Contains all the R scripts for running the Local Search and Threshold Accepting algorithms.
data/: (If applicable) Directory containing data files used in the optimization process.
results/: (If applicable) Directory containing output files and results visualization.
